# obs_ci_setup

creates azure artifacts containing all needed OBS plugin build dependencies

 Windows Archive:
* OBS 23.2.1 source code
* OBS Windows 32 and 64bit builds
* extracted OBS Qt and win dependencies

to be used as single base dependency directly on azure for CI builds of the OBS plugins without too much waste every time
